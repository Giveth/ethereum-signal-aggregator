| The tool that you guys are going to be working on is a website for the aggregation of the different signals, right? You are not going to be working on the specific signals? What we are trying to see here is the exact scope of work that justifies the burn rate per month \($30k per 3 months\) | Not simply website, but more  of the research & design \(e.g. interviews\).  |
| The research of the project you refer to is the series of interviews you will be doing to different stakeholders of the community, right? | Partly yes, the other part would be looking for signals. Research on miners signals for example. |
| We are not going to have the 5 signals included in the website at the end of the project. Only 3 of them? I imagine this is because some of them are still under development. |  |
| You say you will be using existing tools and platforms for this project. Can you give us some examples? |  |
| Regarding the Ethereum influencers list, I understand the list is 100% algorithmically generated, is this algorithm open? |  |
| Regarding the EIPs explorer, can you describe a bit more in detail what are we going to see here, how detailed is this going to be? |  |
| Is somehow a bit difficult to match the deliverable mention here and the ones mentioned in the roadmap can you unify them so we have one list of deliverables? |  |
