## **Vision**

We need a website in the community that we can trust - a fairly high source of truth in terms of recognized people and their skill sets. The main point is to get a website that curates signals of high source of truth which can be used to get an overview of the overall community and its health. List of signals that are helpful and will help to pinpoint what the state of the community really is.

What the end goal is

* A general place or meeting point for the Ethereum community and newcomers.
* A community-curated hub that clears out some of the noise around key developments and decisions facing Ethereum

### Success criteria

* Github statistics
* Ethereum Network statistics
* Easy to find opinions from decisions makers on specific issue / proposals
* Stats / info on Dapps
* Info on Ethereum projects
* Place to view / test the proposals \(EIPs\)
* People trust the resource
* A place where people can gauge what is going on in the community

### Stakeholders:

* Core devs
* Dapp devs
* Miners
* Users
* Nodes
* Exchanges
* Researchers

### Tasks:

* Place to view / test the proposals \(EIPs\)
  * Switch to proof of stake
  * Lowering mining rewards in next hard fork
  * EIP-999, recovery of funds
  * ...
* Specific info on Ethereum projects
* What ppls opinions are about specific issues

## Types of signaling mechanisms:

* Full-node counts
* Mining hashpower
* Token/coin staking/voting
* Identity-based voting
* Specialized TRC of active Ethereum Projects
* Liquid Democracy modeled voting mechanism
